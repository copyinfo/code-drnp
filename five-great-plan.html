<h1 align="right" class="orange-header page-og-header">FIVE <em><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Great Plan</span></em><br /> Things to 1<sup>st</sup> Cut<br />Proposal Success!</h1>


<h3 class="orange-header">1.   <strong><em>Story Time…YOURS…in a Summary</em></strong></h3>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">Tell your story</span></strong>… what are all the <strong>Do More Good</strong> projects you could do with help money from your funders? <strong>Tell them why they should sponsor you. </strong><strong><span class="light-green">This is your Cinderella story! MAKE IT POWERFUL!</span></strong>  Give that funding program officer a reason to dig deeper and deeper into his money chest to grow your projects.

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">Two to four hundred words</span></strong> are all that are standing between you and <em>Doing More Good </em>FOR YOUR EACH AND EVERY PROJECT!

<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">Be clear, specific and concise!</span></strong> Your story needs to be told.


<h3 class="orange-header">2.   <strong><em>How are you going to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Do More Good</span>?</em></strong></h3>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">Program officers need to know</span></strong><strong><span class="light-green">…What they are getting</span></strong> for putting their money with you and your projects.
<ul>
	<li>Make your words clear like glass. Make your words help them<strong> </strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">see exactly what they get when they spend their money with your projects.</span></strong></li>

	<li>Make every word count – each word is worth money to you – <strong><span class="light-green">be <span style="text-decoration: underline;">concrete</span> and state <span style="text-decoration: underline;">measurable results</span> for each project</span>!</strong></li>
</ul>


<h3 class="orange-header">3.   <strong><em>Connect the money dots…with your Story’s goals.</em></strong></h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">Tell your money Story for connecting your goals</span></strong><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">.</span></strong> Your budget story needs to help the program officer see the path over the bridge from their money to your <strong>Do More Good</strong> goals all being completed.</li>

	<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">Connect your project strategies with how the money is</span></strong> being used for your organization’s efforts to complete your <strong><em>Do More Good</em></strong>  vision.</li>
</ul>


<h3 class="orange-header">4.   <strong><em>Budget Smoothie…yummy,tasty numbers</em></strong></h3>
Spread your Spreadsheet with every, every, <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">EVERY expense you write into your Story</span></strong>. Show the program officer why your numbers dig deeper into <strong>DOING MORE GOOD</strong> than anyone else’s proposal.
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">Smoothly account for everything you are spending their money for</span></strong>.  Do not leave anything out!</li>

	<li>The Program Officer has a team of financial wizards who wave their very accurate, magical number wands over each budget. <strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">Check your numbers twice, three times, and then again.</span></strong></li>

	<li>“Magical number wands” have an automatic, <strong><span style="light-green">“If it doesn’t fit, we dump it!” button.  Be careful and complete.</span></strong></li>

	<li>Make sure your <strong><span style="light-green">numbers are accurate everywhere and well blended with everything you propose</span></strong> for <strong>Doing More Good<em>.</em></strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 class="orange-header">5.   <strong><em>Be early, early, and REALLY early!</em></strong></h3>
<strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">Message sent to your funding Program office and soon-to-be partner:  </span></strong>
<ul>
	<li><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;" class="light-green">You plan well + you beat deadlines = you get things done!</span></strong> “The early bird gets the worm,” is true with funding request proposals.</li>

	<li>Most proposals come screeching in the door at the 11<sup>th</sup> hour.  Not yours…you want to <strong>DO MORE GOOD</strong> for your organization.</li>
